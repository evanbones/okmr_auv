Realsense2 reference: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros?tab=readme-ov-file#published-topics

use pcl for projection and segmentation + plane estimation?

5. test getting average point
    - create subscriber node that gets average pose
    - octotree filter it for reduced size?
    - keep a cached list of pointclouds
        - linked list?
        - size defined by ros2 parameter


7. create proper robot state publisher?
    - publish TransformStamped alongside /pose from dead reckoning node?

8. visualize pointcloud in rviz in base_link frame?

future work: 
implement the better visualizer if needed
