use pcl for projection and segmentation + plane estimation?

4. test applying masks
    - test with rectangle

5. test getting average point
    - create subscriber node that gets average pose
    - octotree filter it for reduced size?
    - keep a cached list of pointclouds
        - linked list?
        - size defined by ros2 parameter


7. create proper robot state publisher?
    - publish TransformStamped alongside /pose from dead reckoning node?

8. visualize pointcloud in rviz in base_link frame?

future work: 
implement the better visualizer if needed
