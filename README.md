# Okanagan Marine Robotics AUV Software

## Overview

This repository contains the software for Okanagan Marine Robotic's AUV's

### Install Instructions
``` bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Okanagan-Marine-Robotics/okmr_auv.git
cd okmr_auv/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select okmr_msgs
source install/setup.bash
TODO CREATE DEPENDANCY INSTALLING SCRIPT
colcon build
```

### Package Structure
The codebase is organized into different ros2 packages, with each one containing code related to a 
specific area of the system. For example:
- okmr_controls is for PID related code
- okmr_navigation is for navigation and movement coordination
- okmr_automated_planner is for the high level decision making state machines

Check the specific README.md files inside each package for more details


### Controls Hierarchy
The overall system is designed in a layered manner, with L5 systems making high level decisions,
and every system below that being a step in the chain that makes the L5 systems request a reality


Refresh / processing rate is the main factor that determines what layer a subsystem is in. The slower, the higher the layer. 

This also strongly defines what programming language the code should be written in. 

- L5 = Mission Plan (e.g., root state machaine in Automated Planner) ~30 second period
- L4 = Behavior Logic (specific task state machines, motion planner) ~5 second period
- L3 = Action Coordinators and Perception (navigator, mapper, object detection, system health) 5-20hz
- L2 = PID manager and Action Executors 20-200hz
- L1 = PID controllers ~200hz
- L0 = hardware I/O (motor/sensor interfaces) ~200hz
